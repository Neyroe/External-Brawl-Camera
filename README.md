# External-Brawl-Camera
External Brawl Camera is a port of External Melee Camera made by KELLZ
https://github.com/sadkellz/External-Melee-Camera

If you want to install EBC you have to follow the exaxt same step as EMC, and replace every .py files by mine !
Please don't forget this is an early version, there is some feature missing from EMC because I don't have the knowledge to recreate them..
