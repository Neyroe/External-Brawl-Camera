# DOCUMENTATION
## EXAMPLE
Place holder, place a lot of images
## Known Issues
Z-Axis can only be updated in **pause** ?

You can change **camera position** while in **debug mod**, but the **rotation** while only be **updated on next frame**

You cannot modify Z origin position in game. This is where the camera is looking **(limited by brawl Engine)**

**Camera lock** has to be **Toggle ON** in debug menu (newly automated in last version of EBC)
