## Known Issues
You can change **camera position** while in **debug mod**, but the **rotation** while only be **updated on next frame**

You **cannot modify Z pos for origin** while in game. (This is where the camera is looking, but you can while camera is pausing and you are focusing a player)

**Camera lock** has to be **Toggle ON** in debug menu (newly automated in last version of EBC)
