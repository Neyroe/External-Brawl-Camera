# External-Brawl-Camera
External Brawl Camera is a port of External Melee Camera made by KELLZ
https://github.com/sadkellz/External-Melee-Camera

If you want to install EBC, you have to follow exactly the same steps as EMC, and replace all the .py files by mine !
Don't forget that this is an early version, EBC is missing some features from EMC. 
Sometime I don't have the knowledge to recreate them... especially the one linked between blender and dolphin function so if you can help me I will be very glad !!

VERY IMPORTANT
This application is mean to be use on original Project+ launcher.
I need to take a closer look about project M 3.6 but with 3.6R coming I don't know if It's realy worth.
